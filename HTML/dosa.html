            How to make Dosa
        </h1>
        <p>1. Add ½ cup urad dal (skinned black whole lentils), 2 tablespoon chana dal (bengal gram) and ½ teaspoon methi seeds to a large pot.</p>
        <p>2. Add 1½ cups rice to another pot.</p>
        <p>3. Rinse dals thoroughly a few times and soak in lots of water for 4 hours. During cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</p>
        <p>4. Rinse rice too a few times until the water runs clear. Soak in enough water for 4 hours. Same here as well, during cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</p>
        <p>5. 30 mins before blending the batter, rinse and soak 2 tablespoons poha with ¼ cup water for 30 mins. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Making batter</strong></p>
        <p>6. Add soaked poha to the grinder jar or container first. Drain the water completely from dals and add them along with ½ teaspoon non-iodized salt and ¾ cup water. </p>
        <p>You can also try skipping salt during summer, add it the next morning when you are about to make dosas. It will still ferment well without salt. I use salt when I grind the dal otherwise my batter doesn’t ferment well.</p>
        <p>7. Blend until smooth, frothy and bubbly. If needed add more water. I add another 2 to 4 tablespoons water. But do not make it thin or runny. It must be a thick batter yet of pouring consistency. (Check video for consistency) </p>
        <p>8. Transfer the batter to a a large pot or bowl. Drain rice completely and add to the blender jar. Pour ½ cup water. I use another 2 tbsps more.</p>
        <p>9. Blend to a smooth batter.</p>
        <p>10. Add the rice batter to the urad dal batter. Mix both of them well with your hand. The warmth in the hand is said to help in fermentation. The prepared batter must be of pouring consistency yet thick and not runny. </p>
        <p>If it is too thick you may pour some water at this stage and mix. Thick batter won’t ferment well. If it is slightly runny, it is still fine. (check video for consistency)</p>
        <p>When I double the recipe, I use 2 glass or ceramic pot to ferment and refrigerate the dosa batter. I divide and distribute the batter to 2 pots. Undisturbed batter stays good in refrigerator for longer without going sour.</p>
        <p>11. Cover the pot and ferment it in a warm place until the batter rises and turns bubbly. If you live in a warm region, then you can just keep it on the counter overnight. It may take anywhere from 5 to 16 hours depending on the temperature.</p>
        <p>To ferment in colder regions, preheat the oven at the lowest setting (140 F or 60 C) for 10 mins. Turn off the oven and keep the dosa batter inside with the oven light ON. You can also use your instant pot to ferment with the yogurt settings. Use an external lid and not the IP lid. I ferment for only 7 to 8 hours in the oven &amp; IP.</p>
        <p>12. When I made this, I had to ferment for 16 hours in a closed kitchen cabinet. When properly fermented, the batter raises and turns light, fluffy with lots of pores &amp; bubbles. The batter was half of the bowl before fermentation. It rose a little over ¾ of the same bowl. </p>
        <p><strong>Fermentation test:</strong> To check, drop half a spoon of this batter into a bowl filled with water. Well fermented batter will float &amp; not sink.</p>
        <p>13.This is a closeup shot of how the batter looks after fermentation. For a good fermentation 4 things matter the most – quality of dal, non iodized salt, temperature and the consistency of the batter. You can find more tips &amp; tricks for fermentation on the <strong>soft idli</strong>post which I shared earlier.</p>
        <p>14. Do not over ferment the dosa batter as it turns sour and the batter is not so good to spread on the griddle. This is a picture of over fermented batter just for your reference. </p>
        <p>15. Once your dosa batter is well fermented, keep it in the refrigerator. </p>
        <p>16. The batter will be thick after fermentation. Transfer the required portion to a mixing bowl. Pour little water as needed to make it of a pourable and spreading consistency.  (please check video for consistency).</p>
        <p>17. Add few drops of oil to a griddle or pan. Rub well with a kitchen tissue or cloth until the oil is absorbed. Make sure there is no excess oil on the pan. You can also use a slice of onion to rub the oil. </p>
        <p>18. Heat the pan on a medium high heat. You can sprinkle few drops of water and check if it is hot and ready. It will sizzle immediately. Do not sprinkle water often on a hot non stick tawa that’s going to wear out even the best non stick coating. </p>
        <p>19. When the pan is hot enough, regulate the heat to medium. Stir the batter in the bowl and pour a ladle full of batter in the center of the pan.</p>
        <p>20. Immediately begin to spread it evenly starting from the center in a circular way in clockwise direction to make a thin crepe. </p>
        <p><strong>Troubleshooting tip:</strong> If you are unable to spread the batter because it got stuck on the pan, this means either the pan is too hot or the batter is too thick. Reduce the flame and cool down the pan slightly. If that doesn’t work then pour little more water to your batter to bring to right consistency.</p>
        <p>21. Keep spreading it from the center making circles till you reach the edges.</p>
        <p>22. Regulate the heat to slightly high and let it cook for a minute then add oil or butter towards the edges. The edges of the dosa will begin to leave/ come off the pan when done.</p>
        <p>23. When it turns golden or brown on the base, flip it and cook if you like. Not all dosas require cooking on the other side, if needed you can cook. Since I made the masala dosa, I used this <strong>potato masala for filling</strong>. Plain dosa is most commonly served with <strong>coconut chutney</strong></p>
        <p>Serve the dosa right away when it is hot. They begin to soften as they cool down.</p>
