            How to make Mutton Biryani
        </h1>
        <p>1. Wash mutton thoroughly and drain well. Add ginger garlic paste, salt, turmeric, biryani masala, red chili powder and lemon juice.</p>
        <p>2. Next add curd and oil. If using raw papaya paste you can add it now.</p>
        <p>3. Marinate well and cover. Allow this to rest for at least 4 hours to overnight in the fridge. This marinade tenderizes the mutton. So longer the resting time softer the meat will be. If you are using papaya paste, you can just leave it for 45 mins. I prefer to marinate overnight and refrigerate. I do not use raw papaya.</p>
        <p>4. When you are about to prepare the other ingredients for the biryani keep the mutton out of the fridge. It is good to bring it to room temperature before cooking. You can slice the onions and chilies, soak the rice for 30 to 40 minutes. Soak saffron in milk. Set aside.</p>
        <p>5. Heat a heavy bottom pan or pressure cooker with ghee or oil. Add the spices.</p>
        <p>6. Immediately add sliced onions &amp; green chilies. You can skip this step if using store bought fried onions.</p>
        <p>7. Fry them evenly until golden brown. Set aside half of this.</p>
        <p>8. Transfer the marinated lamb meat.</p>
        <p>9. Add chopped mint and coriander leaves.</p>
        <p>10. Next begin to saute on a very low flame for 3 to 4 mins.</p>
        <p>11. Cover and cook for 10 mins on the low flame.</p>
        <p>12. Either pressure cook it for 2 to 3 whistles. Or continue to cook in the pot until the meat is soft and tender. We are not adding any water to cook this. If cooking in pot make sure you stir occasionally to prevent burning.</p>
        <p>13. While the meat cooks, bring water to a boil and add bay leaf, shahi jeera, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon.</p>
        <p>14. Next add salt.</p>
        <p>15. Then add rice and cook al dente. The rice must be cooked completely but you must feel the bite.</p>
        <p>16. Drain it completely in a colander.</p>
        <p>17. When the meat is soft cooked, you will be left with a thick gravy. Add the rest of the curd to this.</p>
        <p>18. Add the fried onions, coriander and mint leaves.</p>
        <p>19. Mix together. Check the salt and spice by tasting. You can adjust by adding salt or green chilies.</p>
        <p>20. Layer the rice, mint and coriander leaves. Add ghee as well.</p>
        <p>21. Finally pour the saffron milk. Next cover the pot with a foil or kitchen cloth. Place a heavy lid over the pot. If you do not have a heavy lid, place any lid and a heavy pot filled with water over the lid.</p>
        <p>22. Heat a old tawa / griddle or pan until very hot. Place this biryani pot over the pan. Lower the flame and cook for 15 mins. Switch off the stove and allow to rest for 15 mins.</p>
        <p>Serve mutton biryani hot with a raita.</p>
        <p>Both the Lamb/ mutton biryani recipes taste very delicious due to the slow cooking. It is usually served with a <strong>raita</strong> or <strong>salan</strong> or <strong>shorba</strong>.</p>
